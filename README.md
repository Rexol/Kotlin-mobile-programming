# Kotlin Mobile Programming Course

## About

Welcome to the repository for the "Mobile Programming with Native Technologies" course focused on Kotlin mobile development. Throughout this course, I have been exploring mobile app development for the Android OS using Kotlin and the Jetpack Compose framework. Each week, I have delved into various tasks and concepts:

- **Week 1:** Introduction to the Kotlin programming language.
- **Week 2:** Introduction to Jetpack Compose for creating dynamic User Interfaces (UI). An example task includes building a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator.
- **Week 3:** Continuation of UI development with Jetpack Compose. This week, I have implement a login form using icons and text modifiers, with password visibility toggling.
- **Week 4:** Dive into application theming with a focus on the Material theme.
- **Week 5:** Explore state management and UI component segregation. I have implemented a Calories Calculator application with distinct UI elements, each as a separate function.
- **Week 6:** Learn about app layout and navigation. I have created a simple Scaffold application, utilizing fundamental Android components and the navigation-compose module for seamless screen navigation.
- **Week 7:** Understand app architecture, including the UI, domain, and data layers. I have enchansed the BMI Calculator app by integrating the ViewModel as the UI state manager.
- **Week 8:** Connect your app to the internet. I have developed a "Joke of the Day" application using the MVVM architecture and Retrofit for making API calls.
- **Final Project:** As the culminating assessment of this course, I have implemented an ingredient-based recipe finder application. This project incorporates all the techniques covered throughout the course. Please note that the final project resides outside of this repository.
